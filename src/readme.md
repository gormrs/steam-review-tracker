# Funcom python tool test

This test is for you to improve this simple worker that gathers reviews from steam (this could take a long time if steam is slow). First run will generate the database file, then every run after that will also check for deleted reviews and try to clean them up. Your objectives:

1. Run the worker and look at the code for ways it could be improved.
2. Improve the worker to the best of your ability.
3. Dockerify the worker and be mindful about deployment.

Good luck and have fun :)

## Requirements
python 2.7 and docker

## Usage
